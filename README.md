# I'm NoBypass
**and am currently learning development in Switzerland 🇨🇭**

**Finished Projects:**
- [surgo](https://github.com/NoBypass/surgo): a sqlx like library for SurrealDB in Go.

**Currently Working On:**
- [fds](https://github.com/NoBypass/fds) The backend for all FDS apps.
- [fds-bot](https://github.com/NoBypass/fds-bot) A Discord bot implemented in Go for the FDS guild.
- [buzzword-bingo](https://github.com/NoBypass/bullshit-bingo): A minimal buzzword bingo to learn how to work with WebSockets.

My main Project is [FDS](https://github.com/NoBypass/fds) (Pinned)
The plan is to make a modern stats checker for Hypixel and eventually other Minecraft servers.
It also includes a Discord bot for the FDS guild. I'm using this project to learn as many things
as possible, so it is really overengineered.
