# I'm NoBypass
**and am currently learning development in Switzerland**

My main Project is [FDS](https://github.com/NoBypass/fds) (Pinned)
The plan is to make a modern stats checker for Hypixel and eventually other Minecraft servers.
It also includes a Discord bot for the FDS guild. I'm using this project to learn as many things
as possible, so it is really overengineered.

## 🏫 My favourite technologies
- Go with Echo for Web APIs
- SurrealDB
- Astro with Svelte/Tailwind

## ⌚ I want to learn/use in the future
- Kotlin
  - Intellij Plugin Development
  - Minecraft Modding
- Shaders (maybe CUDA)
- Rust
  - WASM
  - Tauri
- HTMX
- K8s
